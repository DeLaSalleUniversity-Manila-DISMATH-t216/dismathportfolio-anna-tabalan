#Week 1: 
- I was introduced to a new and exciting subject.
- I found it odd at first (I still do) but I also found it **very** interesting. 
- Even when the lesson proper hasn't started yet, I was already hooked to the subject especially since I learned the accomplishments of our professor. 
- I learned the purpose of the course (to teach us logic, proofs, algorithm, theories, etc.) and realized that the course will be very useful to us.
- One of the first things we learned is how to think critically, which was done with the Knights and Knaves question.
- We were introduced to the Truth Tables, Propositions, and Logical Connectives.
  - (¬) Negation
  - (∧) Conjunction 
  - (∨) Disjunction
  - (⊕) Exclusive Disjunction
  - (→) Implication
  - (↔) Biconditional.
    -My least favorite would have to Biconditionals.
- After the truth tables, we were also "introduced" to the words Antecedent and Consequent.
- Thereafter, we were taught about:
  - Converse (q→p ≠ p→q)
  - Inverse (¬p→¬q)
  - Contrapositive (¬q→¬p)

#Week 2:
- We were introduced to Logical Equivalences
  - Identity Laws
  - Domination Laws
  - Idempotent Laws
  - Double Negation Laws
  - Commutative Laws
  - Assosciative Laws
  - Distributive Laws
  - De Morgan's Laws
  - Absorption Laws
  - Negation Laws
    - The very first example that our prof. gave us rendered me really *really* confused. But then, upon practicing on my own (even though it took me quite a while to solve at first) I was able to finally get the general flow of the solutions.
    - For me the hardest part to memorize is not the Logical Equivalences but the Implication Equivalences, I'm still having a hard time solving without looking at my notes.
- The next lesson was about Predicate logic which we were told is "concerened not only with logic relations between sentences as *wholes* but also their internal structure in terms of *subject* and *predicate*.
- This is where we were given the Superman Logic assignment (whose many variables I found incredibly frustrating).
  - When I was solving the Superman Logic, I have read the next lesson which we were supposed to use, the Rules of Inference but I only fully understood it when our professor explained it to us in class.
  - He's not real. Sad. 
- We were taught about Existential Quantifiers (∃x, "*there exist*") and Universial Quantifiers (∀x, "*for all*")
- The point that "validity" and "truth" are not the same thing was reiterated, as validity is dependent on the pattern.
- Next was the Rule of Inference, namely :
  - Modus ponens
  - Modus tollens
  - Hypothetical syllogism
  - Disjunctive syllogism
  - Addition
  - Simplification
  - Conjunction
  - Resolution 
    - These are new concepts and just like in the Logical Equivalences, even though I am quite confused at first, with some practice I'm sure I'll understand it more.

#Week 3:
