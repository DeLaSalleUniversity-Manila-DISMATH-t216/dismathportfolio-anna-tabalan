#Week 1: 
- I was introduced to a new and exciting subject.
- I found it odd at first (I still do) but I also found it **very** interesting. 
- Even when the lesson proper hasn't started yet, I was already hooked to the subject especially since I learned the accomplishments of our professor. 
- I learned the purpose of the course (to teach us logic, proofs, algorithm, theories, etc.) and realized that the course will be very useful to us.
- One of the first things we learned is how to think critically, which was done with the Knights and Knaves question.
- We were introduced to the Truth Tables, Propositions, and Logical Connectives.
  - (¬) Negation
  - (∧) Conjunction 
  - (∨) Disjunction
  - (⊕) Exclusive Disjunction
  - (→) Implication
  - (↔) Biconditional.
    -My least favorite would have to Biconditionals.
- After the truth tables, we were also "introduced" to the words Antecedent and Consequent.
- Thereafter, we were taught about:
  - Converse (q→p ≠ p→q) 
  - Inverse (¬p→¬q)
  - Contrapositive (¬q→¬p)

#Week 2:
- We were introduced to Logical Equivalences
  - Identity Laws
  - Domination Laws
  - Idempotent Laws
  - Double Negation Laws
  - Commutative Laws
  - Assosciative Laws
  - Distributive Laws
  - De Morgan's Laws
  - Absorption Laws
  - Negation Laws
    - The very first example that our prof. gave us rendered me really *really* confused. But then, upon practicing on my own (even though it took me quite a while to solve at first) I was able to finally get the general flow of the solutions.
    - For me the hardest part to memorize is not the Logical Equivalences but the Implication Equivalences, I'm still having a hard time solving without looking at my notes.
- The next lesson was about Predicate logic which we were told is "concerened not only with logic relations between sentences as *wholes* but also their internal structure in terms of *subject* and *predicate*.
- This is where we were given the Superman Logic assignment (whose many variables I found incredibly frustrating).
  - When I was solving the Superman Logic, I have read the next lesson which we were supposed to use, the Rules of Inference but I only fully understood it when our professor explained it to us in class.
  - He's not real. Sad. 
- We were taught about Existential Quantifiers (∃x, "*there exist*") and Universial Quantifiers (∀x, "*for all*")
- The point that "validity" and "truth" are not the same thing was reiterated, as validity is dependent on the pattern.
- Next was the Rule of Inference, namely :
  - Modus ponens
  - Modus tollens
  - Hypothetical syllogism
  - Disjunctive syllogism
  - Addition
  - Simplification
  - Conjunction
  - Resolution 
    - These are new concepts and just like in the Logical Equivalences, even though I am quite confused at first, with some practice I'm sure I'll understand it more.

#Week 3:
- Our lesson for the 3rd week is about the Methods of Proof, namely:
  - Direct Proof
  - Proof by Contraposition
  - Proof by Contradiction
  - Vacuous and Trivial proof
- Direct Proof
  - Assume P is true, then show that Q is true.
- Proof by Contraposition
  - Assume ¬q is true, then show that ¬p is true.
- Proof by Contradiction
  - Assume ¬p is true, then show that ¬q is true.
- Vacuous and Trivial proof
  - Vacuous
    - Show that P is false, because p→q must be true.
  - Trivial 
    - Show that Q is true,  q→p must be true.

#Week 4:
- For the 4th week, we discussed Proof by Equivalence (biconditional)
  - show that p→q and q→p are both true. 
- Also a new lesson, Mathematical Induction.
  - P(1) is true
  -  If P(k+1) is true whenever P(k) is true, then P is true for all positive integers.
    - Basis and Inductive Step
- Recursive Algorithm
  - solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller input.

#Week 5
- Discussed and reviewed Recursive Algorithm
- Introduced to a new topic : Program Correctness 
  - Program Verification
  - Hoare Triple
- Another topic : Power Series

#Week 6
- Started discussing Functions
  - Different type of functions such as one-to-one (injective), onto (subjective) and correspondence (bijective)

#Week 7
- no classes

#Week 8
- New topic Algorithm : a finite set of precise instructions for performing a computation or for solving a problem.
- Also discussed pseudocodes, basically a set of codes that are intended for human reading
- Searching Algorithms 
  - Linear
  - Binary

#Week 9
- Different sorting algorithms
  - Bubble sort : analyzes each element and interchanges them to sort
  - Insertion sort : analyzes where in the set a certain element is needed to be inserted
  - Greedy Algorithm
  
#Week 10
- Growth of Functions
 - Big-O Notation : used for upper bound
 - Big-Omega Notation : used for lower bound
 - Big-Theta Notation : used for lower and upper bound
- Time complexity

#Week 11
- None

#Week 12
- Discussed graphs, vertices, edges, etc.
- Introduced to graph terminologies such as Degree and Path
- Discussed Euler Circuit and Path (must pass through all edges exactly once)
- Handshake Theorem : the number of edges is the number of vertices multiplied to the number of degrees divided by 2.
- Discussed Hamilton Circuit and Path (must pass through all nodes exactly once)
- Discussed Isomorphic ices have one to one correspondence), Planar Graphs (no edges intersect), Kuratowski's Theorem (a graph is nonplanar if its subgraph is homeomorphic to a K3 or a K5 graph.

#Week 13
- Discussed trees : an undirected graph without a simple circuit
- Graphs that are not connected are called forests.
- Lesson about Graph coloring and Chromatic number of colors that can be used for a graph.
